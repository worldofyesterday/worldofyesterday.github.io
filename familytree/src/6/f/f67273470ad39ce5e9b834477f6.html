												Budapest Hungary<br />
												August 3, 1913.
					</p>
					<p>
					Dear Mother,
					</p>
					<p>
					It gives me great joy to have the long waited opportunity of writing to you a few words telling you how I fared with this lone and tiresome journey of half way around the earth. &nbsp;When leaving New York, I left with the intentions of sailing only as far as Hamburg, and return with the same steamer. &nbsp;To my surprise, I was transferred to another steamer that wa making excursion trips to different foreign countries. &nbsp;To this I was somewhat glad &nbsp;for I always had a great desire to visit these distant lands. &nbsp;At last, after twenty one days sailing on the ocean, I arrived to Triestte. &nbsp;[ Once the 4th largest city &nbsp;in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. &nbsp;Annexed to Italy at beginning of WW I]. &nbsp; &nbsp;The trip causing me certain unpleasantness (such as sea sickness) I did not care to return (on the same steamer I came) so very soon. &nbsp;As a result, I did not get any money whatsoever for my services, but good fortune brought me enough to travel a little further and try [my luck????]. &nbsp;The suit of clothes that belonged to Morris I sold for 18 Crowns, and having one dollar in my pocket added up my whole fortune to 83 Crowns. &nbsp;My friend Benedict done the same and through almost superhuman efforts we gathered seventy &nbsp;Crowns. &nbsp;Seeing aforehand that work could not be secured in Triestte we decided to go to Budapest and try something there. &nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>
					We purchased two tickets for 65 Crowns and at arrived to Budapest. &nbsp;Today I have been to the American Counsel and he gave me great hopes of enabling me to secure a position in some bank or insurance agency as an English Correspondence (correspondent?). &nbsp; Many others have promised me some good positions for the people out here are very fond of the Americans.
					</p>
					<p>
					The very first day I arrived here, my friend and I went to look for Frank’s mother. &nbsp;Fortunately, we found her and she gave me a very cordial welcome. &nbsp;Kindly tell Frank that I have seen her, and also that at times I have my lunch or &nbsp;supper with her. &nbsp;I tried to find my brother Adolf but it was in vain. &nbsp;Kindly find out his address and send it to me in the coming letter. &nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>
					Benedict asked me to tell you to pardon him for this sudden departure and he wishes to assure you that he has Helen at heart just as before. &nbsp;I also hope, mother, that you will pardon me for this great liberty I have taken without your consent but do hope that this brazen act of mine shall be of much beneficence &nbsp;to me, that when I return, ti shall be a help to the attainment of my future desire; which if attained, I am sure will bring joy not only unto me but unto you also. &nbsp;
					</p>
					<p>
					Hoping you are well, I close with regards to all that may inquire about me.
					</p>
					<p>
					Your loving son,

												Budapest &nbsp;September 1, 1913

					<p>
					My &nbsp;Dear Mother,
					</p>
					<p>
					I hope by this time you have received the letter I answered upon your answer to mine. &nbsp;I believe that what you say about people being surprised about my unthoughtful act is very true. &nbsp;But it is not true that my act was unthoughtful. On the contrary, it was very thoughtful. &nbsp;But mother, it matters not how it was. &nbsp;I am here after all, and wish to tell you once more that I am not decided yet as to if I will stay here or not. In my next letter, I will give you a positive answer as to how long I expect to stay here, or if I do not at all. &nbsp;I was surprised to hear from you, mother, to ask me if I have given up hope of ever finishing school, or attending further. &nbsp;I know not how to start and answer this question. &nbsp;All I can say, mother, is that until now, I have looked upon education as a mere nothing more than but a desire by anyone to possess it. &nbsp;It is first now that I can see the mighty value of it , and above all, the mighty and most needed power of possessing such a thing as an education. &nbsp;Fear not, mother. &nbsp;Even though I have lost one year of school, I am young, and this cause of having lost one year’s schooling has taught me more than I could learn by staying ten years in one place, not budging, but always standing as if I had taken root in the ground. &nbsp;In fact, I tell you, dear mother, that this school of experience has taught me things that could not be learnt in any existing university. &nbsp;This because I have had my eyes and ears open all the time, and even the “rocks had tongues and told tales of wonder and beauty,” as Shakespeare says. &nbsp;Have patience, mother. &nbsp;Fear not. I am of no burden to anyone there. &nbsp;I know just how to limit myself with everything and with everybody. &nbsp;I know just where to stop and where to begin. Have faith in me.
					</p>
					<p>
					I see that you are quite afraid of the authorities holding me back when I desire to return. &nbsp;I have spoken yesterday to the American Counsel, and all is well. &nbsp;Of course if Morris can go to City Hall, and get me a travelling pass for six months, so much the better, but if not, the counsel assured me I’ll have no trouble also. &nbsp;If Morris goes to the City Hall, let him give my name and year I was born. &nbsp;Let him say that on the first papers, I am twenty one. &nbsp;For otherwise, they will not find the papers. And tell them that I did not think passport will be needed as I asked for none before I left. &nbsp;And then, let him tell them that I would like to travel, but a passport is needed to get out of Hungary, and then I believe they will give him one. On my first papers, I am written that I am by trade a bookkeeper, so let him say that also, and let him say that my first papers are last by the Chas. Schweinler &nbsp;Co. &nbsp;In my trunk is a letter from them (?? In the box ?) &nbsp; &nbsp;On the other side of that letter is a number indicating the record of my paper that is stacked away in City Hall. &nbsp;So, if he finds that letter from Schweinler, let him show the number of the paper and the number of the book the paper is recorded on. This number is on the other side of that letter written in pencil. &nbsp;Of course dear mother, all this if only Morris has time. If not, all will be well without it too.
					</p>
					<p>
					Before yesterday, I have gone to visit Adolf. &nbsp;How strange it all was. &nbsp;I got there Friday night and he would not leave me away till Sunday evening. &nbsp;He is an exact image of father. &nbsp;When I have seen him, he had not been shaved and his gray unshaved beard gave him the aspect of an exact image of our father. &nbsp;His wife is a beautiful woman, who speaks perfect English having attended school in New York. &nbsp;Tell Fannie and Sarah that in my next letter I will write more about him telling all I can. &nbsp;He gave me a splendid time. &nbsp;He has a grocery business at 68 Vaci ???. &nbsp; He lives there also. &nbsp;He has five children there from this wife and two from the other. &nbsp;I have only seen the two twin girls and the smallest &nbsp;(one?) boy. &nbsp;They are just grand. Tell me all about our new house. &nbsp;Love to all my brothers and sisters. &nbsp;I hope Helen has been somewhat appeased by the letter I had sent her. &nbsp;This month I will go with Adolf to [ Kayver Uvas ???] &nbsp;and probably to TiszaUjlak [Town where Martin was born]. &nbsp; &nbsp;You probably know that all of …
