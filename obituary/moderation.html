<h2>In all things, moderation</h2>
<P>Michael Gordy</P>

<P>To speak of my father, to speak of what I learned about this private man and what I learned very slowly and imperfectly from his example, I need to say things that would cause him consternation, impatience, or even embarrassment.  There is a paradox at work here.  He lived by certain principles, whether that was by intention or simply in his nature, yet to put those principles into words would seem to him pretentious. So, Dad, bear with me.</P> 

<P><i>In all things, moderation</i>.  That council has serious lineage, going back to the ancient Greeks.  One might say that moderation was Dad’s lifestyle. The flashy on one side, the shabby on the other&mdash;he navigated between those shoals instinctively, drawn to neither shore.  He adhered just enough to the fashion of the day. In the 1970s, when good taste vanished from the face of this earth, he too had hideous sweaters and a dubious mustache, but he wore it with ease and never took it too far.</P> 

<P>More seriously, to me it seemed that Dad’s particular take on moderation was a by-product of humility.  Dad put himself above no one else, whether friend or stranger.  In my 59 years, I never saw him boast, never saw him act with malice or deception.  I was struck by how many of you, in your messages of love and support this week, remarked on Dad’s kindness. (Thank you for that.) As I saw it, what was special about his kindness was that it was unforced, as it came from a genuine and very simple instinct that we are born with equal worth.</P>  

<P>Dad's moderation was about respecting the perspectives and lived experience of others, always aware that he didn’t walk in their shoes. He might offer an opinion on some matter but never with a sense that it was the only fair or reasonable opinion to hold.  His aversion to absolute conviction extended from the personal sphere to the political.  Do the ends justify the means when you are <em>sure</em> your side is right?  Barry Goldwater declared that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice. I can't imagine Dad going along with that sort of bluster.</P>

<P>Growing up in a family that narrowly and only partially escaped the Holocaust&mdash;aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins mostly perished&mdash;I believe that Dad felt in his bones the dangers of dominance and extremism.  To the very end, he could tolerate all sorts of foolishness but never a bully. It’s not my purpose here to stray into politics but if you know my Dad you know he was preoccupied since 2016 by the poison he saw seeping through the fabric of our public life. A card-carrying centrist his whole life, Dad could stomach neither the narcissism and casual cruelty of the former occupant of the White House, nor the cult of personality that hollowed out a party he once supported. I regret that he couldn’t live long enough to see that poison one day drawn and discarded.</P> 

<P>Rarely did he put any of these sentiments in words and never in the form of an admonition to his sons. He taught by example and the rest was for us to work out.  To the extent that he was ever inclined to give it expression, he would say to me simply this:  Live, and let live.</P> 

<P>Dad, I will miss your kindness. I will think often of your generosity and aspire to carry it forward in your memory.  I will miss your jokes, particularly the ones that made your grandchildren cringe.  I will call upon you as my talisman of tolerance and equanimity when I am vexed by foolishness. Most of all, if I attain even a half-measure of your devotion to family, then I can count my own children as blessed.</P>
