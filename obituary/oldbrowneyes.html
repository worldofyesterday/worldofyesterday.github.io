<h2>Old brown eyes</h2>


<pre>
In my favorite photo of him
Grandpa is a child,
brown eyes big, irises clearly
his - even in black and white -
clearly chocolate as the pudding my dad told me
Grandpa stole from his son as any good father would
of course, and I can see the face
Grandpa would’ve made,
eyebrows arched above
eyes wide with an innocence
betrayed by their own laughter.

Those old brown eyes know
how to catch a bear
scooping a fish from the rushing
river or smiling
watching her cubs play
and how to catch a bird with
a berry in its mouth or
in the moment it decides
to fly or
with its wings stretched as far
as they can go. He told me once
to look around, that I have a good eye
but I forgot to ask
what to look for, how to see what he sees
just before he closes the shutter.

I’m sitting alone by the bed.
Grandpa’s eyes flutter open for a moment,
irises still chocolate and still his,
but hazier,
humor and mischief and thoughtful focus
slowly seeping away, becoming
something I cannot name
and I wish this were just a dream
that I could peel off of the truth
that really we just watched an episode of jeopardy
and ate chocolate dove bars with the ridges on top
and I’ll lean over his spot on the couch
where he lies with hands like my dad’s folded over his chest
and after our hug and kisses on the cheek I’ll say
sleep well Grandpa, love you, see you in the morning
and in the morning he’ll wear his robe and slippers and
say hiya kid and I’ll say something that makes him laugh and
later we’ll eat the bagels and lox he got
while I stayed in pajamas 
then in the afternoon I’ll ask him how he sees what he sees in every picture
and in the evening he’ll be back on the couch
and it’s time again for a hug and kisses on the cheek and
sleep well Grandpa, love you, see you in the morning

but the truth lies
in a bed with plastic railings
and pale blue blankets
and I’m letting go of his hand so I
can lean over for a hug and kisses on the cheek and
sleep well Grandpa, love you -
