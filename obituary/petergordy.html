<P>Peter Gordy, 88, of Boca Raton, Florida, died on the 25th of February, 2023, after a brief illness.</P>

<P>Peter was born in 1934 in the Czechoslovak city of Ostrava, son of the late Hilda (Gl√ºck) and Henry Gordy.  Caught up in the Nazi invasion, he and his parents were among the few in his family to escape the horrors that soon transpired.  He was raised in New York City.   He served in the US Army as a radio operator and graduated from City College of New York.  With his father, he founded Gordy Toys, which flourished under his leadership.   Countless first-time entrepreneurs benefitted from his mentorship over 25 years of service through SCORE in Rockland County, NY. He also served for many years as a volunteer driver for the American Cancer Society in Rockland County.</P>  

<P>Peter was an accomplished and passionate photographer, especially of wildlife, and an avid sailor. He had a life-long love of travel, crisscrossing six continents over the decades.</P> 

<P>Above all else, Peter was devoted to his family. He is survived by his wife Carol, with whom he celebrated 60 years of marriage last June, sons Michael, Robert, and Andrew, daughters-in-law Rohini, Rebeca, and Pam, and grandchildren Nina, Julia, Erica, Prayag, Hemakshi, Sophia, and Jackson. He will be greatly missed.</P> 

<P>A memorial service will be held at 11:30am Tuesday at <a href=https://www.louissuburbanchapel.com/>Louis Suburban Chapel</a>, 13-01 Broadway (Rte 4 West), Fair Lawn, NJ, followed by burial in <a href=https://www.cedarparkbethelcemeteries.com/>Cedar Park Cemetery</a>.</P>

<P>In lieu of flowers, donations may be given to the <a href=https://www.adl.org/>Anti-Defamation League</a> or the <a href=https://helenhayeshospitalfoundation.com/>Helen Hayes Hospital Foundation</a>.</P>
