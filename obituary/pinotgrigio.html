<h2>A glass of pinot grigio</h2>

<P><b>Erica</b>: Before we start, Nina wishes she could be here today, but cannot because she’s waiting for the next Gordy girl to make her arrival. This was written by all three of us.</P>

<P><b>Julia</b>: One look at Grandpa’s camera roll will tell you everything you need to know about his life. From his love for sailing, to his adventures traveling around the world, to the way he cared for his family. He captured every memory, and in doing so, he gave everyone around him the ability to cherish all of our experiences together.</P>
    
<P><b>Julia</b>: Bringing the family together has always been very important to Grandma and Grandpa. When most people retire, they downsize their house and move away. Grandma and Grandpa did the opposite, and made sure that the entire family could gather at their house for every occasion. In fact, if we ever left him out, Grandpa would inevitably say, <i>What am I, chopped liver?</i></P>
    
<P><b>Julia</b>: Growing up, we would always visit Grandma and Grandpa’s house. The three of us would run around, exploring the backyard, catching butterflies and going on nature walks--all the while Grandpa took pictures. Little did we know, he was giving us the gift of being able to look back at those pictures and remember our time spent together.</P>
    
<P><b>Erica</b>: For the past six years, I spent winter break in Florida with Grandma and Grandpa. I basically turned into an 80-year-old every time, and yet somehow we lived every day like teenagers. We would fall asleep past midnight after an evening of Jeopardy and Rummikube. Then, we would wake up at noon and spend the day laughing and making jokes, most of which Grandma and I aimed at Grandpa. When I last visited, I asked Grandpa if there was anything left on his bucket list that I could help him with. He told me that he had accomplished everything he wanted to, and was proud of his life.</P>
    
<P><b>Erica</b>: I know when we go home tonight, we’re gonna have a glass of pinot grigio and joke the way Grandpa would… badly. May his memory be a blessing.</P> 

<P>--Nina, Julia, and Erica Gordy</P>
