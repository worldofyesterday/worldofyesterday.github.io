<h2>My role model</h2>

<P>For those of you who attended his 85th birthday party, from his speech you probably learned a lot about his life but maybe not so much about his relationship with his sons. I’d like to set the record straight on that.</P>

<P>I consider myself very lucky to say that my father was my role model in almost every aspect of my life.</P>
<UL>
<LI>As an entrepreneur: Like my father and his father before him, I caught the entrepreneurship bug at an early age and never looked back. Although our businesses were very different, he gave me very solid advice throughout my career. He was a major source of support when my company went through some struggles and was also quick to tell me how proud he was of my accomplishments.</LI>
<LI>As a husband: My Mom and Dad celebrated their 60th anniversary earlier this year, and it was yet another reminder that a long and happy marriage requires a lot of effort but also provides countless rewards. As the years have passed, I truly believe that their relationship only became stronger and stronger.</LI>
<LI>As a father: Somehow, I also followed my father in having three children. I enjoyed telling him that I had it much worse with three daughters as opposed to three sons, but I have a feeling he didn’t always agree with that. My dad taught me to love and appreciate each of my daughters in their own way, and for that I want to thank him.</LI>
<LI>As a sailor: For most of my teenage years and well into my twenties, I spent every weekend with my father sailing on the hudson and beyond. He taught me the language of sailing as well as how to appreciate the peacefulness of moving slowly in a very fast-paced world. </LI>
<LI>Charity: My father was very generous with both his time and his money. After his retirement, he spent a good portion of his time driving cancer patients to their chemo and radiation treatments. Like me, he wasn’t the most social person in the world, but he took the time to talk with these people who not only needed a ride, but also needed someone to help them cope with a terrible disease. As for giving tzedakah, my parents set up a charitable fund and asked my brothers and me to help direct where the funds went. When our children were old enough, we included them in these decisions so they could understand the obligation to give to those who need it most. </LI>
<LI>Retirement: In the coming years, I hope to move on from my current career and, along with Rebeca, start a new phase of my life. My father has shown me how to make the most of my life after retirement by helping others, seeing the world, and spending time with my family. </LI>
<LI>Just last week, my dad gave me one final lesson. I spoke with him in the middle of the night just a couple of hours after he was given a horrible prognosis which meant he would only be with us for a very short time. He said to me the exact same thing he said to my brothers: <it>I had a good run.</it> It took him just a couple of hours to accept his mortality and to realize that he could give my mom, my brothers, and me this final gift. The time we spent with him last week will always be etched in my memory … not because they were so different, but because Dad made them seem so familiar and comfortable.</LI> 
</UL>

<P>I can only hope to be as good a businessman, husband, father, grandfather, and friend as my father was.</P>
