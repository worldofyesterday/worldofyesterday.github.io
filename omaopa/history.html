<center><h2>From Moravia to America</h2></center>

<h3>Opa's Family</h3>

<P>Opa was born Heinrich Goldberger in Ostrava on 
May 20, 1907.  In Opa's words, Ostrava was a town 
"with coalmines and heavy industry and therefore always 
dirty, rarely a blue sky but a good business place and 
people made money."  Opa's parents
were in the butcher supply business.  They owned their 
own building near
the slaughterhouse, with the store on the ground floor
and living quarters above.</P>

<P>Opa's father, Ferdinand Goldberger, was born in 
Myslovice (Moravia) in 1878, and raised in the village of
Hrabyne, on the road between Ostrava and Opava, where 
his parents had a general store.  His father Heinrich
was born in 1844 in Klecza Dolna, Poland, and died in Hrabyne
in 1892.  Ferdinand's mother, Henrietta Ritter, was born somewhere
in Moravia, and died 1908 in Ostrava.  Heinrich and Henrietta
had eight children: Ferdinand, Marie, Julius, Siegmund, Gusti, 
Ludwig, Rudi and Anna.</P>

<P>Opa's mother ran the shop.  Opa loved her dearly, and
she was a fine businesswoman as well.  She was born Helene 
Tramer, daughter of Nachman Tramer, in April 1884 in
Ostrava. Orphaned young, she was raised by relatives.  
She married Ferdinand in 1903.  Henrietta
was born in 1905, but died in 1908.  Opa arrived next,
then Else (1908) and Herta (1915).</P>

<P>In the late 1920s, Opa studied engineering at a college in
Bodenbach.  Bodenbach, called Podmokly now in Czech, is in the
Sudetenland, which was increasingly leaning towards Germany and
Hitler in those years. It was there that Opa first encountered 
significant and persistent antisemitism.  When he finished college, 
the Depression was in full swing and there were no engineering jobs, so he
took a job as a salesman with his father.  He proved a great natural
salesman, and soon was earning more money than his stern father could
tolerate.  To end their arguments, Opa quit and went to work for
the Chungking Import S.A. firm of China.  Opa sold the firm's sausage 
casings in a territory covering Czechoslovakia, Poland, Austria, 
Denmark and Sweden, and remained with this company until he left Europe.</P>

<P>Aunt Else married Fred Brichta in 1928.  Uncle Fred introduced 
Opa to Oma, who was a distant cousin of his.  Opa and Oma married in 
Hodonín in 1931.  Herta married Robert Engle in Ostrava in 1938.</P>

<h3>Oma's Family</h3>
<P>Oma was born Hilde Glück in Hodonín on May 9, 1908.  
Hodonín (Göding in German) is a provincial seat in the south of Moravia,
quite close to the Austrian border.  It was the birthplace of Tomas
Masyrk and an early center of nationalist resistance to Hapsburg
rule over the Czech lands.</P>

<P>Oma's father, Wilhelm Glück, was a merchant in Hodonín.
He owned a dry goods store, or perhaps a small department store.
He was born on September 27, 1862 in the smaller nearby town of 
Straznice.  The Glück family lived in Straznice for generations.  
Records in the state archives show that his parents (Baruch 
Glück and Charlotte Felber), and his grandparents (Samuel 
and Rösel Glück, Moses and Mirel Felber) lived their lives in
Straznice.  In fact, the records in Straznice go back to Wilhelm's
great-grandparents, who were born in the 1740s.
Wilhelm died on January 19, 1931 in Hodonín.</P>

<P>Oma's mother was born Cäcilia Freund on February 7, 1869 in
Lovcice, near Kyjov in south-central Moravia.  Her parents 
were Salomon Freund and Marie Jellinek of Lovcice, and she
had a brother Berthold and a sister Ester.  She and Wilhelm 
were married in Hodonín on August 11, 1895.
Cäcilia passed away from diabetes on December 27, 1916 in
Hodonín.  Oma was only eight years old.  Oma was raised to
some extent by her older sister Malonie (born July 1897)
and had a brother Igo as well.</P>

<h3>War and Refuge</h3>
<P>Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia in March 1939. Opa wanted to
move his family out of Europe, but Dad lacked a valid passport.
Opa went by himself to London in March 1939, and was joined by
Uncle Fred in 1940.  Together they worked to arrange safe passage
for their wives and Paul and Dad, but, in Opa's words, "everything
went wrong."
<blockquote>After I had the visa for England, war broke out between
Germany and England.  I left England in 1940 for Rio de Janeiro to
be in a neutral country, but after I had the visas and tickets
on a boat from Triest to Rio, Italy joined the war and that was the
end of that.  The last try was to bring them by train from Prague
via Berlin-Moscow-Irkutz-Korea to Kobe in Japan.  This time it worked.

<P>The voyage took 41 days from Kobe to Rio on the OSK Line's <i>Montevideo Maru</i> 
and they arrived on January 12, 1941. Later on, the <i>Montevideo Maru</i> was sunk by mistake
on July 1, 1942 off the coast of Luzon, Philippines, by the USS Sturgeon</a>.</P>

<P>Opa, Oma and Dad lived in a furnished apartment in Copacabana.  Dad 
went to kindergarten, and Opa worked on some business interests
in souvenir stores.  But Opa did not see a future for them in Rio,
and soon applied for visas for the United States.
The Goldbergers and Brichtas left Rio on May 20, 1941 on the 
SS Argentina and arrived in New York on June 2.</P>

<h3>Aftermath</h3>
<P>Coming to America meant a new beginning, which Opa
duly noted by changing the family name to Gordy.  But it
carried the burden of irrevocable loss. 
Aunt Else, Uncle Fred and Paul escaped with our family, but Helene
and Ferdinand, Herta and Robert all perished.  Oma lost her
siblings as well.  Among cousins and friends, a few did
survive.  Opa's
Uncle Rudi and Aunt Rosa moved their family from Vienna to Perth,
Australia in 1939, 
and we remain in contact with their children and
grandchildren.  Opa's childhood friend Leo Seifter came to
America.  Oma's cousins on the Freund side escaped to Israel.
I have visited some of our cousins in Haifa, and have been in
touch with others in the Czech Republic, UK, Germany, Italy, and Poland.</P>
